Databases

What is Database & SQL?
Database:
A structured collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to manage large amounts of information efficiently and allow for data retrieval, insertion, and deletion.
SQL (Structured Query Language):
A standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL enables users to perform various operations on data, such as querying, updating, and managing databases.

Purpose of Databases:
Databases are essential for persisting data beyond the lifecycle of a server's operation or an HTTP request. Unlike in-memory storage or flat files, databases ensure data is retained and managed effectively.
ACID Properties:
Atomicity: Ensures complete transactions or none at all.
Consistency: Enforces data rules, ensuring only valid data is saved.
Isolation: Concurrent operations yield the same results as sequential ones.
Durability: Data remains intact despite system failures.
Performance and Scalability:
Databases enhance performance by efficiently handling input/output operations and ensure scalability from small to massive data collections.
CRUD Operations:
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Destroy, which are the fundamental operations for data manipulation in databases.
Types of Databases:
Relational Databases: Use SQL syntax and store data in structured tables (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
NoSQL Databases: Include various non-relational databases, often schemaless and used for different purposes (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
Relational Databases and SQL:
SQL syntax, though challenging, is crucial for manipulating relational databases.
Relational databases use tables to organise data, with rows (records) and columns (fields).
Relations (joins) connect different tables through keys, facilitating complex queries.
Indexing and Joins:
Indexes: Improve query performance by precomputing possible queries.
Joins: Combine data from multiple tables based on relationships, enhancing query efficiency.
NoSQL Databases:
Document-based Databases: Store data in JSON-like documents, offering flexibility but can be harder to scale and manage (e.g., MongoDB).
Key-Value Stores: Use a simple key-value format for efficient storage and retrieval, often used for caching (e.g., Redis).
Hybrid Approaches:
Some databases blur the lines between relational and NoSQL by offering features like document storage within a relational framework (e.g., PostgreSQL’s “hstore”).
Choosing a Database:
The choice depends on specific application needs. Relational databases are versatile and widely used, while NoSQL databases cater to specialised requirements like document storage or large-scale key-value pairs.
In conclusion, understanding both relational and NoSQL databases is crucial for modern software development, given their respective strengths and applications.
